General Logos for RPTools

There's one directory for each tool, and the **RPTools** directory for
miscellaneous or "overall" logos and images.

The largest original resolution images are likely the ones with **403** in
their name, with the **242** images also being originals.  I _believe_ that
others are algorithmically scaled versions, but I'm not positive.
